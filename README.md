Year 2015: using Zig version 0.13.0

Year 2020: using Zig version 0.13.0

I decided to pause after solving part 1 of day 20 of year 2020 because Zig made me waste too much time:
- it lacks the String type (which is very needed for solving the puzzles)
- it is hard to make temporary experiments, because it is always complaining about some variable that should be constant
- managing compatibility with the type 'usize' (used as index and length)
- with the compilation time
- adapting to the verbosity of the standard library functions
- forgeting to write the semicolon
